      Interactive Media 1 is about enabling you to engage with the fundamentals
      of interaction design through the use of web programming. Our focus will
      be on building up from the basic principles of programming, covering the
      standard web languages - HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in order to be able to
      select and use appropriate programming languages, together with core
      concepts of interaction design, in service of your broader digital design
      goals. Course-Specific Learning Outcomes: Upon completion of this course,
      you will have a comprehensive understanding of the key concepts of
      interactivity, user experience design, and information architecture in
      web-based environments. You will also be able to identify and utilize the
      appropriate technologies to address interactive design challenges.
      Furthermore, you will have the skills to analyze user needs, organize
      information, and create effective navigation strategies. Additionally, you
      will be proficient in controlling the visual aspects of typography, color,
      and layouts through scripting languages and coding, ensuring compatibility
      across multiple platforms. Lastly, you will be able to critically evaluate
      web projects based on user-centered design principles.

      In conclusion I think KDA Gragas was an evolutionary skin that was taken
      from us in the early 2018's. We should consider a protest to import this
      skin concept into the game and get riot more money!!! Thank you and
      goodbye.
