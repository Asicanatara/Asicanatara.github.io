<!-- For this assignment I chose a more creative outlet. 
Instead of the ones chosen for us by the university I chose to go off on my own and design a media player relating to a game inspired music mix
Here are my rationale behind the semantics of the code


I wanted the media player to take up a majority of the screen with lyrics to the side and sticky images to the other side
With the controls being in the video player itself.

To achieve this I went with a flex layout and and a sticky key function to keep the image in place when scrolling. -->
