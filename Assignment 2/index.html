<!-- For this assignment I chose a more creative outlet. 
Instead of the ones chosen for us by the university I chose to go off on my own and design a media player relating to a game inspired music mix
Here are my rationale behind the semantics of the code


I wanted the media player to take up a majority of the screen with lyrics to the side and sticky images to the other side
With the controls being in the video player itself.

To achieve this I went with a flex layout and and a sticky key function to keep the image in place when scrolling. -->

      <p class="lyric-spacing">
        <span>I need to keep you around, with my feet tied </span>
        <span>With my feet tied tight to the ground</span>
        <span>The end's nowhere to be found, I don't know why</span>
        <span>You don't leave me to drown, oh, oh, oh</span>

        <span>Don't know where to go unless you say</span>

        <span>Don't know what to do unless you stay</span>

        <span>Thinking that today will be our day</span>

        <span>Be our day again</span>

        <br />

        <span> Why am I playing with time as it's ticking away?</span>
        <span> It's tickin' away, away, I'm asking</span>
        <span> Why we run for our lives, not a second to waste?</span>
        <span> You're tickin' away, away, away</span>
        <br />
        <span>Alright, let's get it</span>
        <span>
          Winnin' (winnin'), losin' (losin'), either way I'm there</span>
        <span>Gotta attitude, I'm out the roof up in the air</span>
        <span>
          This round I make it count, yeah, I'm talkin' right now</span>
        <span>Feel like the comeback kid, I got no time to spare</span>
        <br />
        <span>Woah, double up the score, turn a two to a four</span>
        <span>You know I win a lot, gotta win one more</span>
        <span>On a hot streak, never gets old</span>
        <span>Solo with the ace, and my team went gold</span>
        <br />
        <span>Why am I playing with time as it's ticking away?</span>
        <span>It's tickin' away, away, I'm asking</span>
        <span>Why we run for our lives, not a second to waste?</span>
        <span>You're tickin' away, away, away</span>
        <br />
        <span>You're ticking away, away, away</span>
        <br />
        <span>You're ticking away, away</span>
        <br />
        <span>I'll give it one more try</span>
        <span>I don't know why, but I keep coming back every time</span>
        <span>I want it more than my life</span>
        <span>I don't know why, but it feels so right</span>
        <br />
        <span>Why am I playing with time as it's ticking away?</span>
        <span>It's tickin' away, away, I'm asking</span>

        <span>It's tickin' away, away, away</span>
        <br />
        <span>It's ticking away, away, away</span>
        <br />
        <span>Ticking away, away, away</span>
