      <h2><li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li></h2>
      <p>The first thing that popped up was a loading screen with people animated across the screen it parallel rows. The monochromatic background with green text on the screen gave way for </p>
      <h2><li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions</li></h2>
      <p>For 2 minutes’ worth of studying the page I found myself revisiting the timeline near the middle and scrolling through different animatics. Each of these animatics had a different point and interest that focused my attention on different issues relating to the overall topic. There were some instances where I found myself scrolling to move a Timeline from left to right or to increase the opacity on an image.</p>
      <h2><li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li></h2>
      <p>I think I spent the most time interacting with the heart icon, filling the page with red hearts. I believe they used this interaction method to engage a reader to “send love” to their cause. Even though it doesn’t actually support them it raises awareness.</p>
      <h2><li></li></h2>

      <p>I believe that the goal of this webpage was attract audiences in a fun engaging sense to tackle a serious issue. Janitors do not get enough gratitude for the work they do, because its hard meaningful labour people forget that it’s necessary.</p>
      <h2><li></li></h2>
      <p>By animating the primary points of rubbish cluttering cities, they’ve executed a fundamental point on the issue that is presented.</p>
