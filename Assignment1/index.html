      <p>The first thing that popped up was a loading screen with people animated across the screen it parallel rows. The monochromatic background with green text on the screen gave way for </p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(29, 211, 211)"><li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions</li></h2>
      <p>For 2 minutes’ worth of studying the page I found myself revisiting the timeline near the middle and scrolling through different animatics. Each of these animatics had a different point and interest that focused my attention on different issues relating to the overall topic. There were some instances where I found myself scrolling to move a Timeline from left to right or to increase the opacity on an image.</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(8, 229, 229)"><li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li></h2>
      <p>I think I spent the most time interacting with the heart icon, filling the page with red hearts. I believe they used this interaction method to engage a reader to “send love” to their cause. Even though it doesn’t actually support them it raises awareness.</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(5, 248, 204)"><li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li></h2>
      <p>After 2 minutes of studying this website, I can safely say that the most common action was mostly scrolling and navigating throughout the article. There wasn’t much else apart from clicking the hearts near the footer of the webpage.</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 200)"><li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li></h2>
      <p>I believe that the goal of this webpage was attract audiences in a fun engaging sense to tackle a serious issue. Janitors do not get enough gratitude for the work they do, because its hard meaningful labour people forget that it’s necessary.</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 153)"><li>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</li></h2>
      <p>By animating the primary points of rubbish cluttering cities, they’ve executed a fundamental point on the issue that is presented.</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(0, 255, 119)"><li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li></h2>
      <p>The overall interactive experience with the website was one that allowed the user to play around with different motions that explained the importance of a janitor’s duty and portrayed it in a playful aspect. However, its shown that it can only be interacted with so many times before it becomes repetitive.</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(132, 250, 183)"><li>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</li></h2>
      <p>It doesn’t really have a specific function, though the animation that plays throughout the time scrolling has a great way of communicating interaction to the audience. It’s playful with its progression throughout the page helps assist it’s main purpose to intrigue and capture an audience’s attention.</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(190, 255, 210)"><li>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</li></h2>
      <p>This site references newspapers, old pictures of janitors and renaissance paintings as a media form.</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(182, 208, 255)"><li>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</li></h2>
      <p>When communing with this site, the references not only support the main topic and argument it also creates a push towards a new insight that made me take a new look at janitors and their overall influence on civilisation.</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(155, 163, 255)"><li>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</li></h2>
      <p>Looking at the modes of form, it made me feel very concerned and fearsome for this version of our planet. It has played a toll on being threatening and toys with our emotions to illustrate its point of view on Janitorial influence.</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(206, 174, 251)"><li>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</li></h2>
      <p>The most irritable part of the interaction I found to be was the formation of the timeline. Although it functioned well, in certain aspects it was irritating to use and above all else some of the text was cut off (could have been a monitor issue).</p>
      <h3 style="color:rgb(255, 137, 216)"><li>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</li></h2>
      <p>I stand by the fact that I spent a good number of the study clicking the hearts to fill the screen. I don’t know exactly why I found this satisfying, but it could have something to do with the interactivity or the sense of completion when filling the screen. </p>
